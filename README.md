🌾 Rice Plant Leaf Disease Detection using MobileNetV2
📋 Overview
This project uses a e MobileNetV2 model to detect diseases in rice plant leaves. By analyzing images of leaves, the model can classify them into categories such as healthy or diseased, helping farmers take timely actions to protect their crops.

🎯 Features
Efficient classification of rice leaf diseases using MobileNetV2.
Pre-trained weights for faster and accurate predictions.
User-friendly pipeline for training, validation, and testing.
Supports multiple disease categories.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow
Keras
MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning)
Jupyter Notebook
OpenCV (for image preprocessing)
